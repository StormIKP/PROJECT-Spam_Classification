Spam 
This project demonstrates a Spam Classification System built using Python and Machine Learning algorithms. The system is designed to classify messages or emails as spam or non-spam, providing an effective solution for detecting unwanted content.

Code Requirements
To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies:

scikit-learn: Install using pip install scikit-learn.
Pandas: Install using pip install pandas.
NumPy: Install using pip install numpy.
Matplotlib: Install using pip install matplotlib.
Tkinter: Available by default in Python.
Steps to Follow
Download the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/iswarkumarpatra/PROJECT-Spam_Classification.git  
Prepare the Dataset

Ensure the dataset is properly formatted and located in the data/ folder.
If no dataset is available, follow the instructions in the project to fetch or generate it.
Run the Script

Open spam_classifier.py or the main script provided in the repository.
Update any file paths or configurations based on your local environment if needed.
Execute the script:
bash
Copy code
python spam_classifier.py  
Train the Model

The system will automatically train the model on the provided dataset.
The trained model will be saved in the models/ folder for future use.
Test the Model

Test the system using sample input data to verify its functionality.
Adjust parameters or algorithms as needed for optimal performance.
Project Structure
Dataset Preparation:

Prepares the data required for training and testing the spam classification model.
Training the Model:

Trains a machine learning model to classify messages as spam or non-spam.
Testing and Evaluation:

Tests the system using test data and evaluates its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall.
Spam Classification UI (if applicable):

A user-friendly interface for manual testing and classification of messages.
Outputs
Trained Model:

The trained model is saved in the models/ directory.
Results:

Results are displayed in the terminal or GUI with classification output and accuracy metrics.
Logs and Reports:

Any logs or reports related to training, testing, and results will be stored in the logs/ or reports/ directory.
Future Enhancements
